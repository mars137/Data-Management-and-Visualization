<strong>Research Questions for Data Analysis</strong>

Prevalence of self-treatment and conccurence of alcohol drug usage in psychic disorders
After exploring all the topics within the code book, I was particularly interested in psychiatric disorders, which is common among many people in our present generation. The  psychiatric disorders include: major depressive disorder, bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, dysthymia, and hypomania. After going through all the mood disorder variables, Initially I thought of studying self-treatment methods employed to improve mood in by dysthmia patients. Later I thought of extending the study to self-treatment methods in all the psychiatric disorders conditions.



<strong>Research Questions:</strong>

Prevalence of Self-treatment of psychiatric disorders with alcohol or drugs to improve the mood in NESARC
mood disorders and drug/alcohol use co-occur in psychiatric disorder conditions




<strong>Literature Survey 1:</strong>

Self-medication of mood disorders with alcohol and drugs in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions by James M. Bolton , Jennifer Robinson , Jitender Sareen.

<strong>Background</strong>

: Using alcohol or drugs to reduce emotional distress (self-medication) has been proposed as an explanation for the high comorbidity rates between anxiety and substance use disorders. Self-medication has been minimally studied in mood disorders despite equally high rates of alcohol and drug use.

<strong>Results</strong>

: Almost one-quarter of individuals with mood disorders (24.1%) used alcohol or drugs to relieve symptoms. The highest prevalence of self-medication was seen in bipolar I disorder (41.0%). Men were more than twice as likely as women to engage in self-medication (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.18; 95% Confidence Interval 1.90â€“2.49). After controlling for the effects of substance use disorders, self-medication was associated with higher odds of comorbid anxiety and personality disorders when compared to individuals who did not self-medicate.

<strong>Conclusions</strong>

: The use of alcohol and drugs to relieve affective symptoms is common among individuals with mood disorders in the general population, yet is associated with substantial psychiatric comorbidity. These findings may help clinicians identify a subgroup of people with mood disorders who suffer from a higher mental illness burden.

<strong>Literature Survey 2:</strong>

Co-occurrence of 12-Month Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders and PersonalityDisorders in the United States

<strong>Background</strong>

 Very little information is available on the co-occurrence of different personality disorders (PDs) and alcohol and drug use disorders in the US population.

<strong>Objective</strong>

 To present national data on sex differences in the co-occurrence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) alcohol and drug use disorders and 7 of the 10 DSM-IV PDs.

<strong>Results</strong>

 Among individuals with a current alcohol use disorder, 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7-30.6) had at least 1 PD, whereas 47.7% (95% CI, 43.9-51.6) of those with a current drug use disorder had at least 1 PD. Further, 16.4% (95% CI, 15.1-17.6) of individuals with at least 1 PD had a current alcohol use disorder and 6.5% (95% CI, 5.7-7.3) had a current drug use disorder. Associations between PDs and alcohol and drug use disorders were overwhelmingly positive and significant (P < .05). Overall, alcohol use disorders were most strongly related to antisocial (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% CI, 4.1-5.6), histrionic (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.8-5.8), and dependent (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.8) PDs. Drug use disorders also were more highly associated with antisocial (OR, 11.8; 95% CI, 9.7-14.3), histrionic (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 6.0-10.7), and dependent (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 7.1-19.1) PDs. Associations between obsessive-compulsive, histrionic, schizoid, and antisocial PDs and specific alcohol and drug use disorders were significantly stronger (P < .04) among women than men, whereas the association between dependent PD and drug dependence was significantly greater (P < .04) among men than women.

<strong>Conclusions</strong>

 The co-occurrence of PDs with alcohol and drug use disorders is pervasive in the US population. Results highlight the need for further research on the underlying structure of these disorders and the treatment implications of these disorders when comorbid.

<strong>Hypothesis:</strong>

Based on my literature survey, I can come to hypothesis that Self-assesment with alcohol/drug to reduce the depression disorders and also both usage of alcohol and drug use co-occur in psychiatric disorders.
